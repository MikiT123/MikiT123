## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello! My name is Michaela Tang and I am a senior at the Academy for Information Technology. I can program in HTML, Java, Python, C#, and PHP.
In the future, I would like to work as a Cybersecurity Engineer.
I hope to collaborate with others and build on my programming skills using GitHub.

## Hobbies
I enjoy playing the piano, and I love working out in my free time.
I love swimming, and am on the varsity team for my high school.
Game design is also something I wish I had more time for; I have fun designing 2D games in Unity using C#.

## Professional Experiences
I  have worked at the Lift and Shift Foundation, where I created a CAPTCHA with accessibility features for the visually impaired.
I also work as a Water Safety Instructor (WSI) at the Jewish Community Center of Central New Jersey. I teach people of all ages and special needs children.
